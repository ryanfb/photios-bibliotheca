# 211

Read Dionysius of Aegeae. It has the title "Dictyaca". It's a little book made up of 100 chapters, each of these is a hypothesis itself being argued (there were 50 of these), the other 50 consisting of seriously arguing against themâ€”each against each, frankly comparing each of them by a means of practice and according to a sequence of refutation.

The mode of expression is neither embellished nor laid down beautifully, and is not otherwise flashy but instead aims to be an effort of exercise in writing, taking care to be spare in style and consistent. But this little book is useful to those practicing the dialectical arts.
